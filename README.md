**App will be developed in different [repo](https://github.com/S4d3ngineer/pixel-canvas-ts), because I am going to rewrite it in TypeScript before developing it further.**

My first React app, which I am using as training ground.

For now it allows users to draw on 512x512 canvas (with single grid cell size 16x16) by pressing left mouse button and dragging cursor over the canvas area. It also allows to erase pixels selectively with help of right mouse button, or clear all canvas at once, by clicking "Clear" button. Drawing can be exported to png - just press "Save as png" and wait for the download prompt.
I am going to work on adding more functionality in the following days, e.g. changing background/pen colors, resizing canvas, changing grid resolution etc.
